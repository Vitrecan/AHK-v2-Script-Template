# AHK-v2-Script-Template
This is an AutoHotkey script that allows you to run it as admin, reload it with Ctrl+S, and exit it with Ctrl+Esc. It also sets some global settings and variables, and allows you to write context-sensitive code for different programs. You can modify the ini section to store values that need to be permanently saved.
